<h2>Description</h2>
<p>I learned about these noodles from a J. Kenji Lopez-Alt youtube video and they are one of the dishes which I have made most often over the last two year.  They fit all criteria: delicious, easy, and quick</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>100 grams Spaghetti</li>
    <li>1 tbs butter</li>
    <li>4 garlic cloves (minced)</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon oyster sauce</li>
    <li>1 tsp fish sauce</li>
    <li>1 tsp soy sauce</li>
    <li>1-3 tbs grated parmesean cheese</li>
    <li>(optional) scallions/green onions, sliced</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Start cooking your spaghetti in about 1/3 - 1/2 the water recommended.  You want to have less water than you normally would so the water gets extra starchy</li>
    <li>In a sauce pan, melt the butter and add the garlic on low heat.  You want to cook the garlic but it doesn't need to be golden brown.  Set aside as the pasta cooks</li>
    <li>When the pasta has a minute to go, remove it from the pot and add it to the sauce pan with the garlic</li>
    <li>Add the soy sauce, fish suace, oyster sauce, and cheese, and stir until combined and creamy</li>
    <li>Serve in bowl and top with scallions</li>
</ol>
