    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Eggs are a super food.  For the calories they are nutrient and protein dense.  There are also numerous ways to prepare eggs.  Hard Boiled eggs are perhaps the easiest way to prepare eggs.  All you need are eggs, 10-15 minutes, and a pot of boiling water.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pot of boiling water</li>
        <li>Unpeeled eggs (1-6)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Boil a pot of water</li>
        <li>Add the eggs to the boiling water.  Be careful not to crack the eggs.  It's not recommended to use more than 6 eggs at a time since that can drop the water temperature too much</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat immediately after adding your eggs</li>
        <li>Let the eggs cook for 10-12 minutes</li>
        <li>Take the eggs out and run them under cold water or put them in an ice bath to stop the cooking</li>
        <li>Enjoy</li>
    </ul>
